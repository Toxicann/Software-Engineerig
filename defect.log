    Dict_Customer[custID]['custName'] = custData[2] <<<<<>>>>> this line caused the following error
        Exception has occurred: KeyError
        '3'
        File "E:\Python\SE Assignment 2\program.py", line 27, in customer
            Dict_Customer[custID]['custName'] = custData[2]
        File "E:\Python\SE Assignment 2\program.py", line 12, in readFile
            customer(lines)
        File "E:\Python\SE Assignment 2\program.py", line 50, in <module>
            readFile()

    
    so i replaced the line with :
        Dict_Customer[custID] = {'custName': custData[2], 'custAmt': float(custData[3])}

    the program runs alright but shows the following error in the problems message
        "totalAmt" is possibly unbound
    to fix the error, i had to initialize the variable as:
        totalAmt = 0
