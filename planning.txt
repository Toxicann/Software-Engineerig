Python will be my choosen language for this program.
I will write a function that will read the 'data.txt' file provided by using file handling
Since there are 3 process(lines starting form 'e' ,  'c' or 't') in the data provided,
These lines of process will be read and sent to their respective functions for further processing.

I am guessing the total lines of code required for this program will be somewhere around 100ish lines of code.

Task                                                             Time
Writing file handling function                                   15 mins
write employee function(adds employee data to map)               15 mins
write customer function(adds customer data to map)               15 mins
write transaction function(adds trans data to variable)           5 mins
write a function that prints required data after calculation     20 mins    

I forgot to add a function that prints the looped number as shown below:
    123456789012345678901234567890123456789012345678901234567890

write a function that prints the above result                    10 mins
